- Detect base URL detection to automatically handle URLs other than
  echo360.net.au, such as echo360.com.

- Save cookies returned after each request. This might fix the 403 errors.
- Check if external download failed in experimental mode and stop the script.
  This should prevent a bunch of empty folders from being created for lectures
  that failed to download.
