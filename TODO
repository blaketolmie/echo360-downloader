- Detect base URL detection to automatically handle URLs other than
  echo360.net.au, such as echo360.com.
- Use http.cookiejar to read cookie file.
- Save cookies returned after each request. This might fix the 403 errors.
- Add ability to pass URL on command line.
- Maybe invoke x mode automatically when no downloadable videos are available.
- Could have lecture folders with more descriptive names, eg:
  001 - [Group Name - ]Lesson Name (Date Time)
  This addresses situations where there are groups of lectures
  and where one lecture has been broken up into multiple parts.
